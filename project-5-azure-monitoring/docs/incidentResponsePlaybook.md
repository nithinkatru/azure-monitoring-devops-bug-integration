# Incident Response Playbook

## Introduction

This playbook provides guidelines to respond to alerts triggered by the Azure Infrastructure Monitoring system.

## Steps

1. **Alert Received:**  
   - Validate the alert details on the custom monitoring dashboard.

2. **Verify Data:**  
   - Query the Log Analytics workspace to confirm the anomaly (e.g., verify elevated CPU usage).

3. **Initial Investigation:**  
   - Identify affected virtual machines and services.
   - Review system and application logs.
   - Check network and service status for contributing factors.

4. **Ticket Creation:**  
   - A ticket is automatically generated in Azure DevOps.
   - Verify the ticket details and assign the incident to the appropriate response team.

5. **Remediation:**  
   - Follow predefined remediation steps.
   - Escalate the issue if immediate resolution is not achievable.

6. **Post-Incident Review:**  
   - Document the root cause analysis.
   - Identify and implement improvements.
   - Update the playbook based on lessons learned.

## Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review and adjust alert thresholds.
- Refine queries based on observed behavior.
- Update response procedures based on incident outcomes.
